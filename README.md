Personal Project Descriptions:

**ILoWord:**

ILoWord is a fast-paced word typing game where randomly generated words fall from the top of the screen, and the player must type them before they reach the bottom. The game challenges the playerâ€™s typing speed and accuracy as the difficulty increases over time.

**Key Technologies:** Java, Random Word Generation

**Features:**

Random word generation with a countdown timer.

Increasing difficulty as more words are generated.

**Run It:** Clone the repository and run ILoWord.java in your preferred Java environment.


**How Accurately Can We Predict Inflation Using Economic Factors?:**

This project aims to predict inflation rates by analyzing key economic factors such as GDP changes, unemployment rates, consumer sentiment, and federal funds rates. We used economic datasets from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to model inflation and uncover relationships between various economic indicators.

**Key Technologies:**

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Features:**

Data cleaning and preprocessing, including the creation of lagged variables to account for delayed effects.
Multivariate linear regression model to predict inflation rates based on economic features.
Evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to measure model accuracy.
Visualization of economic trends and relationships using line plots and scatterplots.
Results: The model showed that lagged economic features improved the prediction of inflation, with an R-squared value of 0.60 when considering up to four-quarter lags.
