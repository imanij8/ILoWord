Personal Project Descriptions:

**ILoWord:**

ILoWord is a fast-paced word typing game where randomly generated words fall from the top of the screen, and the player must type them before they reach the bottom. The game challenges the playerâ€™s typing speed and accuracy as the difficulty increases over time.

**Key Technologies:** 

Java, Random Word Generation

**Features:**

Random word generation with a countdown timer.

Increasing difficulty as more words are generated.

**Run It:** Clone the repository and run ILoWord.java in your preferred Java environment.


**How Accurately Can We Predict Inflation Using Economic Factors?:**

This project aims to predict inflation rates by analyzing key economic factors such as GDP changes, unemployment rates, consumer sentiment, and federal funds rates. We used economic datasets from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) to model inflation and uncover relationships between various economic indicators.

**Key Technologies:**

Python, pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib

**Features:**

Data cleaning and preprocessing, including the creation of lagged variables to account for delayed effects.
Multivariate linear regression model to predict inflation rates based on economic features.
Evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to measure model accuracy.
Visualization of economic trends and relationships using line plots and scatterplots.
Results: The model showed that lagged economic features improved the prediction of inflation, with an R-squared value of 0.60 when considering up to four-quarter lags.

**The Psychological Impact of Social Media on Mental Health:**

This project investigates the relationship between social media usage and mental health outcomes, focusing on anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and social comparison. By analyzing a custom database tracking social media usage patterns and mental health indicators of six participants, we explore how different types of content (positive, negative, or neutral) impact mental well-being.

**Key Technologies:**

SQL, Database Design

**Database Structure:**

Participants: Tracks demographics, social media platform usage, and mental health conditions.
Social Media Usage: Records platforms used, hours spent, and interaction levels, linked to participants.
Mental Health Assessment: Captures participant mental health outcomes and connects to both the Participants and Social Media Usage tables.

**Features:**

Designed a relational database to capture complex data on social media use and mental health.
Analyzed correlations between social media habits and mental health outcomes to explore potential areas for intervention.
Developed mock data to simulate participant behaviors and track mental health patterns influenced by social media content.

Goal: To provide insights into the impact of social media on mental health and suggest recommendations for improving well-being based on usage patterns.
